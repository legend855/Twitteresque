Twitteresque

This is a Database project for a web application that implements a model of the Twitter database.

the project is organized in two folders: public_html, and src. public_html contains the user interface to access the queries in the form of index.html. src contains three folders; css (containing the stylesheet for the project), queries (containing the php files associated with all the sql queries that we have implemented), and utils (which contains three php files that are used throughout the project; login, logout, and connect).

index.html acts as a portal to all of the queries. queries are organized on this page in order, starting at query1, in ascending order.

the ten assigned queries have been completed, and in addition we have included extra queries
as defined below to add expanded functionality to the project:

query 11: create a new user Account
query 12: change a users Password
query 13: delete a tweet. Will also delete comments on that tweet.
