# Twitteresque

#### Authors: Patrick Kyoyetera, Kevin Strathdee

This is a Database project for an application that implements a model similar to Twitter's database.

The project is organized in two folders: public_html, and src. public_html contains the user interface to access the queries in the form of index.html. src contains three folders; css (containing the stylesheet for the project), queries (containing the php files associated with all the sql queries that we have implemented), and utils (which contains three php files that are used throughout the project; login, logout, and connect).

index.html acts as a portal to all of the queries. queries are organized on this page in order, starting at query1, in ascending order.

### Queries
The ten assigned queries have been completed, and in addition we have included extra queries
as defined below to add expanded functionality to the project:

query 11: create a new user Account <br />
query 12: change a users Password <br />
query 13: delete a tweet. Will also delete comments on that tweet.
